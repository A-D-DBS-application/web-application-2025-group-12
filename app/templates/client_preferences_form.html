{# ===========================================================================
   CLIENT PREFERENCES FORM REDIRECT
   
   This template has been unified with preferences_form.html to eliminate
   duplication. Both company and client users now use the same template,
   which adapts based on session.role.
   
   This file is kept for backwards compatibility but simply includes the
   unified preferences_form.html template.
