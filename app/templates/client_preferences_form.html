{# Client wrapper that reuses the unified preferences template.
   Instead of extending base again and including a full page (which caused
   the navbar to appear twice), we extend `preferences_form.html` so the
   template inheritance chain remains single (client -> preferences -> base).
#}
{% extends "preferences_form.html" %}

{# No additional blocks needed; we inherit the title and content from
   preferences_form.html which already adapts based on session.role. #}
